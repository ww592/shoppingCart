# shoppingCart

➡ Overview:
Shopping Cart is an interactive web application allowing regular users to sign up, log in, add products to cart and purchase. An admin was manually added as
an user to add products and sell. The whole project is built with Spring framework because it gives good support for dependency injection and inversion of
control. Hibernate is used in this application in order to map an object-oriented domain model to the relational database. It provides caching mechanism for better
performance. The purpose is to get familiar with the current popular framworks for shopping services, as well as having good programming practice using interfaces
for future compatibility. In this application:

• Front-end: jQuery, jsp, AngularJS, Bootstrap

• Back-end: RESTful, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Web Flow


➡ Highlight of the back-end:
• Spring MVC is a powerful yet lightweight container. It is not server dependant and does not require special deployment steps. Use of Dependency Injection along with AOP(Aspect Oriented Programming) makes object creation and dependency management easy.

• Spring Security provides a highly flexible OAuth2 implementation. It is possible to write OAuth client, OAuth resource server and also OAuth authorization server. It enables Spring to integrate and inherit the feature of OAuth2 security with almost complete configurability.

• Spring Web Flow is built upon Spring MVC. All flows can be centrally configured in an XML file and will not have an overhead of carrying over the data from one request to another as it can be done by flow scope. 

• Hibernate is an ORM(Object Relational Mapping) implementation. It is database independent. It will work with all kind of databases like Oracle, MySQL, NoSQL etc.  It has a layered architecture and supports inheritence, associations and collections.
